# La Mia Passione Maltese - Website for my parents maltese breeding üê∂

https://lamiapassionemaltese.pl/

<br />

### About Project

My parents had a website but it was made by my father in something like wordpress so... UI and UX wasn't really friendly and it was looking like taken from 2000 year. Also some things just didnt work.
It's a one page website so it's pretty simple. There is couple of basic sections like: "About us", "Our dogs", "Exhibitions", "Buying process", "Faq" and of course "Contact".
My main goal was to make it interesting and vivid. Personally I think that a good website is a website which will drill into your mind for a while.
